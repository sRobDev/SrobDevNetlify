Hey everyone.

It took me long enough, but after a couple busy months at work, I've finally had time to jump back into learning more about React.

I've never been the most competent at algorithms, so after some timely inspiration from the SyntaxFM podcast, I decided to set out to create my own algorithm visualizer with the aim to not only teach myself algorithms, but to teach other people as well.  

I have a lot of plans for this project, and it is not anywhere near done yet, but I wanted to at least get it out there.  The visualizer is hosted on a github page over here: 

https://srobdev.github.io/algoviz/

And you can find a working list of my future feature plans on my GitHub page here:

I have a local list of bugs and general polish that I need to work through, but if you find anything out of the ordinary while clicking around, please let me know!
