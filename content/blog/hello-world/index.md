Hey everyone.  

As you can see, this site is a work in progress and this is just what I could get up in one evening.  
My vision for this site is to simply be a place to store/link my resume, portfolio, and write any posts about web development topics that I find interesting, or feel competent enough to write about.  I don't expect it to turn into much, but it'll be a good place to start experimenting.  

Right now, I work as a UI Engineer for Comcast Technology Solutions.  We work on a stack of AngularJS (1.7) and Node 8 over a Postgres DB.  Despite continuing to learn new things at work, I feel that I've stagnated in some ways, especially in regards to newer frameworks such as React, Vue, etc.  My plan is for this site to be one of the driving forces behind keeping myself motivated to learn and expand my knowledge as a developer, so that I can have portfolio projects (and small experimental things) to link here.  

Teaching and writing about new topics is also one of the best ways to learn.  I'm not much of a blogger, and have never written about tech topics, but this is at least a small step in that direction.

Thanks for reading, and I'll be sure to have more content up as I learn and grow in this new adventure.
